"""API router for the Suggest Post Assignments feature.

Routes:
    POST /sieges/{siege_id}/post-suggestions
        Generate (and store) a greedy assignment preview.

    POST /sieges/{siege_id}/post-suggestions/apply
        Apply a caller-filtered subset of the stored preview atomically.

The /post-suggestions kebab-case sibling segment avoids the route-shadow
risk that /posts/suggest would have if a future /posts/{post_id} endpoint
were added.  See plan § "API endpoint" for the full rationale.
